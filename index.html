      <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>
      <p>
        BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their
        height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely
        used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body
        weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the
        calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is
        underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range
        the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such
        as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories
        such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or
        underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an
        imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of
        whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table
        below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the
        calculator.
